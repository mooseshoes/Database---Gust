	My imaginary database holds information for a shopping website.  Information being held: customer's id,
first name, last name, credit card number, address, email, phone number, each with a column in the customer
table.  I also have a table of orders and a table of products each with data such as product and orders ids.
 The data is stored using a relational model with a 1 to many relationship between the customer and the orders
table, and a many to one relationship between the orders table and the products table.  The data is 
meaningless without context, there's no point in data if nobody knows what it represents.  Once given the 
context for what the data represents it becomes usable information.

	The Hierarchical Model just sets up a simple hierarchy, so that the each piece of data has a single 
"parent" up until you reach the top of the hierarchy.  The Network Model is the same as the Hierarchical model
 except the pieces of data can have one or multiple "parents".  The relational model makes is easier to
 represent different objects being children to the same parent, it's just much easier to express the
 relationships between different pieces of data using the Relational Model.
